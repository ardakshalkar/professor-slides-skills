/**
 * Does the slide keep the promise its archetype made?
 *
 * The plan says what each slide is — `roadmap`, `worked_example`, `question` —
 * and every archetype carries a density band and a set of text roles. Until
 * this file existed, nothing ever compared that declaration against the
 * markdown. A slide could be planned `roadmap` (sparse, headline and labels)
 * and ship five paragraphs, and `pres check` would say "No problems found."
 *
 * That is the exact shape of the defect this catches, found by reading a real
 * deck: slide 2 planned as a roadmap, seventy-eight words of prose, no picture,
 * and every sentence *about* an artifact that could have been shown instead —
 * on the slide immediately before one that did show it, correctly, in the same
 * deck. Nothing was broken. Everything checked. The slide was still wrong.
 *
 * Two things are measured, and only what the archetype itself declares:
 *
 *   **the band**  words carried as prose, against `DENSITY[archetype.density]`
 *   **the roles** paragraphs of explanation where the archetype asked for labels
 *
 * Both are warnings, never errors. The bands are documented as generation
 * defaults rather than limits — density is intrinsic to some content, and a
 * derivation is dense because derivations are — so this reports and the
 * professor decides. What it must not do is stay quiet.
