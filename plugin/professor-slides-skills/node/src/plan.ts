/**
 * The two files that stand between a module and a rendered deck.
 *
 * **The outline** (`<deck>.outline.yaml`) is the argument of the session before
 * any of it is written: the arc, the slide sequence, and an honest statement of
 * what it covers and what it leaves out. It carries a `status`, and that status
 * is the whole approval mechanism here — there is no `ainar approve` in a
 * standalone plugin, so the gate has to be a fact in a file the professor can
 * read and edit.
 *
 * **The plan** (`<deck>.plan.yaml`) is the render contract: the approved slide
 * sequence plus what every figure needs in order to be shown lawfully. It is
 * the standalone replacement for the parent's `Document.presentation_plan`, and
 * `pres render` reads it rather than trusting whoever is driving.
 *
 * They are separate because they answer to different people. The outline is
 * reviewed by a professor; the plan is enforced by a program. Merging them
 * would mean either a professor reading licence metadata or a renderer trusting
 * prose.
