 *   **deck grammar**      what sequence teaches this topic
 *   **slide intent**      what the learner is doing on this slide
 *   **visual archetype**  how that information should be represented
 *
 * A generator that jumps from "section" straight to "slide" produces a
 * collection of individually reasonable slides that does not teach: title and
 * three bullets, fifteen times, because nothing ever told it that the
 * *cognitive operation* changed. Naming the intent separately from the
 * representation is what makes the variation follow from the teaching rather
 * than from a rule saying "do not repeat a layout".
 *
 * Everything here is a controlled vocabulary because `pres outline check` reads
 * it. `references/visual-grammar.md` is the prose; this is what is enforced.
